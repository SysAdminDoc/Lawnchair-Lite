# Lawnchair Lite Roadmap

Minimal, fast Android launcher built on Jetpack Compose with professional-grade stability (v2.26.0). Stability architecture already landed; roadmap pushes performance, visual polish, and feature-parity with premium launchers.

## Planned Features

### Home & Drawer
- **Blur behind drawer** — RenderEffect blur on Android 12+ (feature-detect, no crash on older OS)
- **Per-page wallpaper dim** — different dim per home page

### Gestures & Actions
- **Per-app gesture assignment** — long-press an app icon to bind custom gesture set (quick actions, shortcuts)
- **Gesture recorder** — trace a shape on the home screen as a custom gesture, bind to action
- **Global shortcuts shelf** — dock-style row of arbitrary app shortcuts (not apps) accessible via swipe
- **Assistant replacement** — swipe-up-from-corner launches chosen assistant (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity)

### Performance
- **Baseline profile** — ship `baseline-prof.txt` to cut first-launch startup
- **R8 full-mode** — enable full optimization, verify no reflection breaks
- **Icon bitmap cache tuning** — bounded-memory LRU with explicit bitmap recycling
- **Drawer lazy-column pre-warm** — pre-measure on first open to eliminate first-scroll jank

### Themeing
- **Material You dynamic color** — opt-in per theme, pulls monet palette from wallpaper
- **Theme import/export** — share full theme + icon-pack + accent as a `.lawnchair-theme` JSON
- **Icon pack mixer** — pick icons from multiple packs at once with fallback chain
- **Custom font** — user-selectable font via font file import

### Widgets & Info
- **Widget stack** — stack multiple widgets in one slot, swipe between (iOS smart stack parity)
- **At-a-glance card** — weather + next calendar + next alarm + unread-count aggregation
- **Search suggestions 2.0** — web suggestions from chosen engine via suggestion API with caching

### Settings & Backup
- **Selective backup** — export/import specific sections (gestures only, theme only, layout only)
- **Cloud backup** — optional gdrive/onedrive/webdav backup of the JSON layout
- **Backup schedule** — auto-backup weekly to `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/.../backups/`

### Stability
- **Crash analytics (local)** — persist uncaught exceptions with stack + device state to a local log viewer in Settings
- **OEM skin compatibility matrix** — automated install test on Pixel, OneUI, MIUI, ColorOS, OxygenOS, HyperOS via cloud device farm in CI
- **Work profile parity** — dual-profile app drawer with badge, respect org policies

## Competitive Research
- **Lawnchair (upstream)** — Lite is derived from; pull performance/stability fixes from main branch, keep feature set intentionally smaller.
- **Nova Launcher** — gold-standard paid launcher; reference for gesture flexibility and backup granularity.
- **Smart Launcher 6** — excellent auto-categorization; borrow UX not implementation.
- **Niagara Launcher** — list-first minimalist; proves there's appetite for minimal. Lawnchair Lite should keep that ethos without becoming Niagara-shaped.
- **Kvaesitso** — open-source, search-first; reference for fuzzy-search ranking.

## Nice-to-Haves
- Wear OS companion for quick-launch from wrist
- Tablet/foldable layout (large-screen dual-pane drawer, taskbar)
- Android Auto companion launcher (distinct APK, shared theme engine)
- Experimental: LLM-powered search that understands "my gym app" → returns Strong
- Theming API so icon pack authors can define accent + wallpaper suggestions per pack
- Private space integration (Android 15 private space) with biometric unlock

## Open-Source Research (Round 2)

### Related OSS Projects
- LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair — https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair — upstream; Lawnchair 16 on Launcher3 from Android 16; this project's direct parent
- MM2-0/Kvaesitso — https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso — search-first launcher, universal search across apps/files/cloud/contacts/wikipedia; v1.40.1-fdroid (Apr 2026)
- Posidon — https://github.com/Posidon-Software/posidon_launcher — one-page launcher with RSS feed, One UI-inspired
- Olauncher — https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher — minimal text-only launcher (no icons)
- NeoApplications/Neo-Launcher — https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Launcher — highly customizable FOSS launcher, another Launcher3 derivative
- KISS Launcher — https://github.com/Neamar/KISS — <2MB, Android 5+, zero-background
- Rootless Pixel Launcher (amirzaidi/Launcher3) — closest-to-AOSP reference; minimal patch over Launcher3
- T-UI Launcher — https://github.com/ossrs/t-ui-launcher — terminal-shell style, type-to-launch
- Smartspacer — https://github.com/KieronQuinn/Smartspacer — system-level At-a-Glance replacement; Lawnchair integrates with it
- QuickSwitch — Lawnchair's recents bridge; reference for Android 10-15 integration (root)

### Features to Borrow
- **Universal search bar from home screen** (Kvaesitso) — apps + contacts + files + calendar + web results in one query field; top-tier QoL addition
- **Scrollable widget canvas as optional home page** (Kvaesitso) — decouples widgets from grid cells
- **Local calculator + unit converter in search** (Kvaesitso) — no network, instant answers
- **At-a-Glance via Smartspacer integration** (Lawnchair upstream) — weather / calendar / media card at top of home; "Lite" can still include it
- **Per-app icon override** (Neo Launcher, Lawnchair) — with icon-pack support; already a Lawnchair feature, make sure Lite preserves
- **Material You wallpaper-color theming** (Lawnchair upstream) — inherit free from base
- **App drawer search with fuzzy match** (KISS) — typo-tolerant; KISS's CompareString algorithm is a good reference
- **Gesture: swipe-up-on-home to open drawer** (Lawnchair, Posidon) — ensure preserved; one-finger reachability
- **Hide app from drawer / private space** (Lawnchair, Neo) — hidden-apps list with PIN reveal

### Patterns & Architectures Worth Studying
- Lawnchair's **Launcher3 fork-rebase cadence** — they rebase onto each new Android's Launcher3 rather than diverging; makes AOSP upgrades tractable. "Lite" must preserve this discipline
- Kvaesitso's **search provider plugin model** — each search source (apps/files/wiki/cloud) is an independent provider implementing a common interface; users toggle providers individually
- Smartspacer's **virtual widget host** — shows how to inject a "pluggable" widget slot without being tied to one content source
- Posidon's **single-page canvas** vs. multi-page pager — architectural choice; "Lite" should document which model it commits to
- **Strip-for-size tactics** — to earn the "Lite" name, benchmark baseline Lawnchair APK (~30MB) and prune: drop Hermes/flutter deps if present, disable unused icon packs at build, aggressively R8-shrink; KISS is the north star at <2MB

## Implementation Deep Dive (Round 3)

### Reference Implementations to Study
- **amirzaidi/Launcher3/src/com/android/launcher3/widget/WidgetHostViewLoader.java** — https://github.com/amirzaidi/Launcher3 — canonical `AppWidgetHostView` bind + `bindAppWidgetIdIfAllowed` + fallback to widget-picker activity pattern. Template for Lite's `AppWidgetHost` integration.
- **LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/lawnchair/src/app/lawnchair/LawnchairLauncher.kt** — https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair — upstream Lite derives from; rebase-onto-Launcher3 cadence is in `lawnchair/versions/` directory. Check before attempting AOSP upgrades.
- **MM2-0/Kvaesitso/app/ui/src/main/java/de/mm20/launcher2/ui/launcher/search/SearchVM.kt** — https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso — provider-plugin search architecture. Each provider (`apps`, `contacts`, `files`, `wikipedia`) implements `SearchableRepository<T>` interface. Direct blueprint for Lite's "Search suggestions 2.0".
- **KieronQuinn/Smartspacer/app-legacy/src/main/java/com/kieronquinn/app/smartspacer/ui/activities/configuration/ConfigurationActivity.kt** — https://github.com/KieronQuinn/Smartspacer — SystemUI Smartspace bridge + Target plugin protocol. Required path for Lite's At-a-Glance card.
- **tanujnotes/Olauncher/app/src/main/java/app/olauncher/helper/AppCompare.kt** — https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher — lightweight fuzzy-search compare. Compare against Lite's current `ranking 100/90/80/70/60/50` and steal anything simpler.
- **Neamar/KISS/app/src/main/java/fr/neamar/kiss/utils/fuzzy/FuzzyScore.java** — https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/blob/master/app/src/main/java/fr/neamar/kiss/utils/fuzzy/FuzzyScore.java — diacritic-insensitive matching and bigram scoring. Template for Lite's fuzzy-search v2.
- **NeoApplications/Neo-Launcher/src/com/saggitt/omega/iconpack/IconPackManager.kt** — https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Launcher — icon-pack XML fallback chain with per-pack priority. Direct match for Lite's "Icon pack mixer" roadmap item.
- **android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher3/.../model/data/WorkspaceItemInfo.java** — https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher3/+/refs/heads/main/src/com/android/launcher3/model/data/WorkspaceItemInfo.java — upstream AOSP model for workspace items. Lite's `AppModel.kt` can mirror the field names for backup compatibility with AOSP launchers.

### Known Pitfalls from Similar Projects
- **Widget picker must handle `canBindAppWidget` failure** — Developer docs — without `BIND_APPWIDGET` (only grantable to system), must launch `ACTION_APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE` via `AppWidgetHost.startAppWidgetConfigureActivityForResult`. Lite v2.19.0 already surfaces toast on failure but verify the fallback config-activity path.
- **Glance composables do not inter-operate with Compose UI** — cannot reuse Lite's existing Compose components in a Glance widget. If shipping widgets (not just hosting), duplicate UI code in `GlanceModifier`. https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/demystifying-jetpack-glance-for-app-widgets-8fbc7041955c
- **Glance `setWidgetPreview` rate-limited to ~2 calls/hour** — Android 15+ — cannot re-render widget previews on every change. Cache aggressively and batch updates.
- **Android 16 `system_app_widget_background_radius` = 24dp + content padding for 28dp clipping** — widgets missing sufficient inner padding get content clipped. If Lite ships its own widgets, bake in 28dp padding margin. https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/appwidgets
- **`AppWidgetHost.startListening()` must be called in `onStart`, stopped in `onStop`** — leaking across activity recreation causes `SecurityException: Widget n not bound to host`. Lite's `MainActivity.kt` handles this but verify after Compose BOM bumps.
- **Launcher3 base classes rename between AOSP versions** — `WorkspaceItemInfo` was `ShortcutInfo` pre-Q. Lite's internal model wrapper must absorb these renames; Lawnchair upstream tracks via `lawnchair/versions/`.
- **Contacts search requires `READ_CONTACTS` runtime permission** — Lite already shows permission chip but must re-check after system revokes permission for unused apps (Android 11+ auto-reset feature). https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission
- **Themed icons monochrome drawable resource only on Android 13+** — older Android shows transparent icon. Lite guards on `Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU` but verify via Android 12 emulator.
- **Private Space integration requires `PROFILE_OWNER` or privileged system access** — Lite cannot natively integrate with Android 15 Private Space. Only hidden-apps + PIN-reveal is feasible.
- **DeviceAdmin `lockNow()` permission revoked on uninstall leaves orphaned admin records** — Lite's `AdminReceiver` needs a clean deactivation in `onDisableRequested`. Users who uninstall without deactivating hit a stuck "device admin" entry.

### Library Integration Checklist
- **Smartspacer (At-a-Glance)** — `com.kieronquinn.smartspacer:plugin-sdk:1.0.0` — entry: `class LawnchairSmartspaceClient : SmartspacerClient(context) { override fun onSmartspaceUpdate(targets: List<SmartspaceTarget>) { ... } }`. Gotcha: requires Smartspacer companion app installed; graceful-degrade to "install Smartspacer to enable" prompt if not present.
- **AppWidgetHost (framework)** — no dep; `AppWidgetManager.getInstance(context)` + `AppWidgetHost(context, APPWIDGET_HOST_ID=1024)`. Entry: `host.startListening(); val id = host.allocateAppWidgetId(); manager.bindAppWidgetIdIfAllowed(id, provider)`. Gotcha: `APPWIDGET_HOST_ID` must be stable across app versions or you orphan every bound widget ID — Lite uses 1024 (locked-in).
- **Accompanist DrawablePainter** — `com.google.accompanist:accompanist-drawablepainter:0.36.0` (pin) — entry: `Image(painter = rememberDrawablePainter(drawable), contentDescription = null)`. Gotcha: Accompanist is end-of-life; Google recommends replacing with `Painter.fromDrawable()` from Compose 1.7+. Plan the migration before next Compose BOM bump.

## Research-Driven Additions

- [ ] P0 - Add backup privacy rules and backup content controls
  Why: Android Auto Backup is enabled while launcher preferences include search history, app usage, hidden apps, widgets, and layout data.
  Evidence: `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, `app/src/main/java/app/lawnchairlite/data/LauncherPrefs.kt`, Android Auto Backup and backup-risk docs
  Touches: `AndroidManifest.xml`, `res/xml/`, `LauncherPrefs.kt`, `SettingsScreen.kt`, backup tests
  Acceptance: Manifest data extraction rules explicitly include/exclude launcher state, manual export offers history/usage toggles, and restore/import behavior is documented in Settings.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P0 - Audit platform permissions and graceful degradation
  Why: Play/F-Droid readiness depends on explaining or removing broad permissions such as `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`, `BIND_APPWIDGET`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, and `KILL_BACKGROUND_PROCESSES`.
  Evidence: `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, Google Play package-visibility policy, Android exported/permission docs
  Touches: `AndroidManifest.xml`, `LauncherViewModel.kt`, `SettingsScreen.kt`, README permission section
  Acceptance: Every dangerous/broad permission has a visible feature owner, runtime status, denial recovery, and documented distribution rationale; unused or system-only permissions are removed.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P1 - Add Compose accessibility semantics and a11y tests for custom controls
  Why: Many chips, rows, drag/drop targets, icon buttons, and image-only controls are custom `clickable` elements without roles, state descriptions, or test coverage.
  Evidence: `SettingsScreen.kt`, `AppDrawer.kt`, `Components.kt`, Compose semantics and accessibility-test docs
  Touches: `SettingsScreen.kt`, `AppDrawer.kt`, `Components.kt`, `HomeScreen.kt`, Compose UI tests
  Acceptance: Switch-like rows expose switch semantics, chips expose selection state, icon/folder/widget actions have labels, TalkBack traversal is predictable, and automated accessibility checks cover Settings plus drawer search.
  Complexity: L

- [ ] P1 - Localize user-facing strings and prepare translation workflow
  Why: Settings, drawer, Smartspace, toasts, dialogs, and backup messages are hardcoded, blocking i18n and accessibility polish.
  Evidence: `SettingsScreen.kt`, `AppDrawer.kt`, `Components.kt`, `LauncherViewModel.kt`, Kvaesitso/F-Droid translation practices
  Touches: `res/values/strings.xml`, UI files, ViewModel toast callers, tests
  Acceptance: User-visible text is resource-backed, formatted strings use locale-safe placeholders, and at least one non-English resource file builds without string-format crashes.
  Complexity: L

- [ ] P1 - Version backup schemas with dry-run restore preview
  Why: Import is defensive but silently skips fields and has no schema compatibility report for old, partial, future, or cross-launcher files.
  Evidence: `LauncherPrefs.kt`, Nova/Smart Launcher backup migration expectations
  Touches: `LauncherPrefs.kt`, `AppModel.kt`, `SettingsScreen.kt`, backup tests
  Acceptance: Import validates schema version, previews sections to be restored, reports skipped/unknown fields, preserves existing state until user confirms, and tests cover legacy and future backups.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P1 - Add local diagnostics export beyond crash notifications
  Why: Crash reporting depends on notifications and clipboard copy, leaving no Settings-visible history or support bundle when notifications are denied.
  Evidence: `LauncherApplication.kt`, `CrashCopyReceiver.kt`, Kvaesitso debug export pattern
  Touches: `LauncherApplication.kt`, `SettingsScreen.kt`, local files directory, diagnostics tests
  Acceptance: Settings shows recent crash entries, package/build/device/app-state summary, copy/share/delete actions, and a no-notification fallback after uncaught crashes.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P2 - Modernize Android and Compose dependency lane
  Why: The app is on AGP 8.2.2, Kotlin 1.9.22, Compose BOM 2024.01.00, DataStore 1.0.0, Activity 1.8.2, and Accompanist DrawablePainter 0.34.0.
  Evidence: `app/build.gradle.kts`, AGP release notes, Compose updates, existing Accompanist note in this roadmap
  Touches: Gradle files, `Theme.kt`, icon rendering call sites, tests, release build
  Acceptance: Dependencies are bumped in a controlled branchless commit, deprecated APIs are removed where practical, release/debug builds pass, and icon rendering no longer depends on stale Accompanist APIs if a stable Compose replacement is available.
  Complexity: L

- [ ] P2 - Improve fuzzy search for diacritics, transliteration, and aliases
  Why: Current ranking is fast but basic; KISS/Kvaesitso-style search handles user typos, accents, initials, and learned ranking better.
  Evidence: `LauncherViewModel.kt`, `AppCategorizer.kt`, KISS fuzzy search, Kvaesitso search providers
  Touches: `LauncherViewModel.kt`, new search scorer class, `AppCategorizer.kt`, tests
  Acceptance: Search normalizes diacritics, supports initials and common app aliases, preserves current exact/start/word ranking priority, and adds deterministic tests for accented and typo-heavy app names.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P2 - Add drawer folder/group parity without changing the home grid model
  Why: Nova and Smart Launcher users expect drawer folders or groups, while Lite currently has home/dock folders plus drawer tabs/categories/favorites.
  Evidence: `AppDrawer.kt`, `LauncherPrefs.kt`, Nova folders/groups, Smart Launcher automatic categories
  Touches: `AppDrawer.kt`, `LauncherPrefs.kt`, `AppModel.kt`, `SettingsScreen.kt`, backup tests
  Acceptance: Users can create named drawer groups/folders from existing apps, assign apps manually or by rule, persist them through backup, and still use All/Recent/Favorites/Work tabs.
  Complexity: L

- [ ] P3 - Add migration import for popular launcher backups
  Why: Switchers from Nova, Smart Launcher, and upstream Lawnchair expect layout transfer before they commit to a new launcher.
  Evidence: Nova FAQ/backups, Smart Launcher docs, Lawnchair upstream backups, `LauncherPrefs.kt`
  Touches: new import adapters, `LauncherPrefs.kt`, `SettingsScreen.kt`, import tests
  Acceptance: Import accepts at least one documented third-party backup format, maps compatible apps/folders/dock items, reports unsupported widgets/settings, and never overwrites the current layout without preview confirmation.
  Complexity: XL

- [ ] P3 - Prepare F-Droid/libre distribution metadata and flavor audit
  Why: FOSS launcher users discover alternatives through F-Droid, and this repo needs a clear no-tracker, no-cloud, reproducible local-build story.
  Evidence: F-Droid launcher category, Kvaesitso F-Droid listing, manifest permissions
  Touches: Gradle flavors if needed, README, metadata files, release process notes
  Acceptance: A libre-compatible build path is documented, metadata avoids proprietary service assumptions, requested permissions are justified, and the APK can be built locally with the same signing/release checklist.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P0 — Reconcile release metadata with shipped code
  Why: Local release notes currently claim v2.27.0 backup privacy controls while tracked build/README metadata and source code remain v2.26.0 without backup data extraction rules.
  Evidence: `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `app/build.gradle.kts`, `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, `app/src/main/java/app/lawnchairlite/data/LauncherPrefs.kt`
  Touches: `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `app/build.gradle.kts`, release checklist
  Acceptance: Version strings and release notes only describe features present in tracked code; backup privacy claims are either implemented or removed before the next release artifact.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P1 — Add local Android 15/16 launcher smoke harness
  Why: Platform changes around Private Space, archived apps, widget previews, edge-to-edge, and package visibility need local launcher-specific verification without hosted CI.
  Evidence: Android 15 Private Space/app-widget docs, `AppRepository.kt`, `HomeScreen.kt`, `MainActivity.kt`, repo no-GitHub-Actions rule
  Touches: Android instrumentation tests or local adb smoke script, `AppRepository.kt`, `HomeScreen.kt`, `LauncherViewModel.kt`, Gradle test config
  Acceptance: A local command installs the release/debug APK on an emulator or attached device, opens the launcher, exercises drawer/search/settings/widget-picker golden paths, records pass/fail output, and documents any platform feature that must degrade gracefully.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P1 — Split launcher state services out of `LauncherViewModel`
  Why: Search, Smartspace, widgets, backup, contacts, app loading, and gesture actions all live in one large ViewModel, making roadmap items harder to test safely.
  Evidence: `app/src/main/java/app/lawnchairlite/LauncherViewModel.kt`, Kvaesitso provider architecture, existing backup/search/widget roadmap items
  Touches: `LauncherViewModel.kt`, new search/smartspace/widget/backup service classes, unit tests
  Acceptance: Search scoring/providers, Smartspace loading, widget placement/bind decisions, and backup import/export each have a focused class with deterministic unit coverage while public UI behavior remains unchanged.
  Complexity: L

- [ ] P2 — Improve widget picker previews and destructive widget recovery
  Why: Competitors differentiate on widget stacks/pop-up widgets, while Android widget-host docs emphasize durable host IDs and user-visible previews; current picker is label/search centered and widget removal has no confirmation.
  Evidence: Android AppWidgetHost and widget preview docs, `Components.kt`, `HomeScreen.kt`, KISS issue 2610, Action/Niagara widget stack features
  Touches: `Components.kt`, `HomeScreen.kt`, `LauncherViewModel.kt`, widget tests
  Acceptance: Widget picker displays provider preview imagery when available with icon fallback, empty/error states explain unavailable previews, removal confirms before deleting host IDs, and tests cover preview fallback plus cancel/remove behavior.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P2 — Add shortcut and PWA icon override parity
  Why: Neo and Fossify issue signals show shortcut/PWA icons are a recurring launcher polish gap, and Action Launcher-style quick icon alternatives are a premium differentiator.
  Evidence: Neo Launcher issue 309, Fossify Launcher issue 315, Action Launcher Quickedit feature, `ShortcutRepository.kt`, `IconPackManager.kt`
  Touches: `ShortcutRepository.kt`, `IconPackManager.kt`, `AppModel.kt`, `Components.kt`, `LauncherPrefs.kt`, backup tests
  Acceptance: Pinned shortcuts and web/PWA entries can use icon-pack or manual fallback icons, overrides persist through backup/restore, and missing icon resources fall back without blank icons.
  Complexity: M
